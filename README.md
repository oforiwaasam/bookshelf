# Bookshelf

## Description

Our goal is to provide a platform where users are able to enhance
their reading habits while getting cheaper options to get books.

Users will be able to keep track of their progress on the user page
and will be able to get book options when they search for any books,
authors, ISBNs, or authors.

There will also be suggestions of books from the New York Times
Bestsellers Lists as well as suggestions based on other users'
reading habits.
